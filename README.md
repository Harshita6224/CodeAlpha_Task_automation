**📌 Task Automation with Python Scripts**

A collection of Python automation scripts developed as part of my CodeAlpha internship to simplify repetitive, real-life tasks.
These scripts demonstrate how Python can save time, reduce errors, and make work more efficient.

**📂 Project Overview**

This project contains three automation tasks:

**1️⃣ Move .jpg Files to a New Folder**
